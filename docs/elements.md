Each notification is an [element](https://craftcms.com/docs/4.x/elements.html).

## Anatomy of a Notification

A notification contains three parts:
1. **Event** - Notification will be activated by a specific [event](/events/) within the Craft system.
2. **Message** - Notification sends a specific [message](/messages/) when the event is triggered.
3. **Recipients** - Notification will be sent to a specific set of [recipients](/recipients/).
