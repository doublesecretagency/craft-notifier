# Custom Recipients

ðŸš©

Sends the message to **a dynamic set of recipients, as defined by a Twig snippet.**

Specify which custom recipients will be notified. Any dynamic Twig logic will be parsed at runtime.








Use the Twig snippet to build an array of either **Users** or **email addresses**.

- [Get a collection of Users](/recipients/custom-users)
- [Get a collection of email addresses](/recipients/custom-emails)
