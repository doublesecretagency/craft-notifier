# Notifier plugin for Craft CMS (beta)

**Send custom Twig messages when Craft events get triggered.**

---

**Want to share new posts with your audience? Need to get notified when something changes?**

The Notifier plugin allows you to create messages which will be sent out whenever certain triggers are activated. Configure a notification trigger, then add as many outgoing messages as you wish. Each message can be sent to a specific group of recipients, and message templates can be easily managed via Twig.

**Whenever a trigger is activated, all corresponding messages will be sent out.**

Setting up a new notification is a breeze...

### Step 1

**Add a [trigger](https://plugins.doublesecretagency.com/notifier/triggers/)**. This ties directly to an event in Craft. (While in beta, the only available trigger is "on save Entry".)

### Step 2

**Add a [message](https://plugins.doublesecretagency.com/notifier/messages/)**. You can assign one or more messages for each trigger. (While in beta, only email messages are available.)

> **Beta Soft Launch:**
>
> While in beta, this plugin is shy of just a few key features. Before the 1.0 official release, we will add:
> - Support for more event triggers.
> - Support for text/SMS messages.
