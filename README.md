**A super-flexible notification hub for Craft CMS!**

It can be best explained with the following formula:

```
When an [EVENT] occurs, send a [MESSAGE] to designated [RECIPIENTS].
```

There are endless reasons why you may need a combination of these event/message/recipient types.

For more details, see the [complete documentation...](https://plugins.doublesecretagency.com/notifier/)

## How It Works

### Event Types

## Write Messages in Twig

All messages can be composed using [normal Twig](https://plugins.doublesecretagency.com/notifier/messages/templating), including a set of [special variables](https://plugins.doublesecretagency.com/notifier/messages/variables) which are available at runtime.

## Advanced Logging

All outgoing messages will be [logged](https://plugins.doublesecretagency.com/notifier/logging), to give you a detailed view of how each message was handled...
